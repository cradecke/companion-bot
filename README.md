This is my copy of the repository of my group's capstone project. I worked with four other individuals to help create this code.

api_secrets and the AWS access key are not included in order to prevent leaked access. You will need to provide your own subscriptions and API keys to run this program.

The target hardware is a Raspberry Pi 4b 4GB and an Arduino MEGA. 
.py files are for the Raspberry Pi and the .ino is for the Arduino

This project does not have much of a commit history since I added it to my repos retroactivly.
